            <strong>How will the restaurant receive the orders they get through their website?</strong><br />
            Every order placed will be sent via fax/email/web or POS. Restaurants also have the option to review their orders instantly through their Online Control Panel. Zuppler tracks all orders to make sure the restaurant receives EACH order ticket. For orders sent by fax or email, Zuppler will confirm that your staff received the order by sending an automated phone call to the restaurant. Zuppler's 24/7 Support Team will monitor and handle orders that are NOT confirmed. This is our "No Order Left Behind" Policy.
          </p>

            <strong>How do I change the appearance of Zuppler content?</strong><br />
            
            Zuppler designers will work to apply your colors as a first step in our configuration process. So once you receive the integration instructions, the color palette is already there. Zuppler content is rendered directly on your website pages, no iframes, no hidden stuff, and this makes our service so great and flexible. You have total control over the Zuppler content appearence as you have for your entire website by simply editing your stylesheets. It's just a matter of identifying the element to be styled, and then override its appearance from your css. <br />
            A simple example for changing your prices style: <code>#zuppler-menu .z-item .z-price { font-size:16px }</code>
